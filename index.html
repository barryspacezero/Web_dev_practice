        <p class="p"><i>“Do you know what Spider-Man is? He’s a hand grenade with a bad haircut! Every time you hear about him, there’s a car wreck, a fire, or something destroyed! And when he’s not causing mayhem, he’s nowhere to be found, hiding in the shadows! The real heroes are out there every day, putting their lives on the line in the open, not skulking around like rats!”<i></i></p>
